sshMenu (Pronounced Shmenu, you know like a shmear)

Take this do what you will.   Credit is nice  ;)

I am a sysadmin and 9 out of 10 times, when I open a terminal I am sshing somewhere...   so I just created this little diddy so when i open a terminal I can easially connect to a remote server.

Its very useful when you add it to your .bashrc.

Installation.
	Put the files somewhere for you
	Edit the conserver.sh file and modify any operating variables you like.
		Change the location of th ServerInfo list as this is currently pointed to a custome one I cannot share for security reasons.
	Edit the ServerList file to add your servers
	
Optional:
	Edit the SewrverListInfo file if you left it enabled.
	Add this to your ~/.bashrc file.


**Use at own risk**  But in all honesty, I cant see how this can be damaging.
